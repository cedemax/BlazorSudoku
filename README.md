# BlazorSudoku

The idea is to provide an easy to use tool that can help a user solve a tough sudoku. 
This is achieved by implementing human-style solving techniques (based on the documentation on [HoDoKu](http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/techniques.php)).
The user can then get visual hints from the solver, which provides either the "least complex" next step available, or a next step using a technique of the users choice. 

The tool can be tested on https://cedemax.github.io/BlazorSudoku/
